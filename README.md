# Train Scheduler
## Class Assignment #7 ##

This is a website that allows you to add train information to a leaderboard and determine future departure times. Site was created using JavaScript logic with jQuery handlers for DOM manipulation, and Moment.js NPM module to calculate time differentials against current time. New trains can be added to the board and are saved to a Firebase database. Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and custom CSS have been applied for aesthetics.
